once you download and install VS Community, on the "Workloads" tab, select "Desktop Development with C++"

near the "Install" button, there's a Drop-Down menu, click on it, Select "Download first, then Install"

now wait until it finishes, it is recommended to reboot your PC once it finishes, but it's not needed at all

# Terminal Setup & Compiling Game

- on Windows: press "Windows+R" and type in "cmd", if you don't like cmd, or you just use something different, open that program instead
cmd is usually faster, that's why I'm recommending it!

- on some Linux Distros: Press "CTRL+ALT+T" and a Terminal window should open -- although, if you are on linux, you probably know that already
- on other Linux Distros: Usually in your applications menu, or press Ctrl+Alt+2-6, Ctrl+Alt+7 usually get you back to your desktop

- on Mac: Press cmd+space and type "Terminal" into spotlight or open Launchpad and look for Terminal
type in these commands
