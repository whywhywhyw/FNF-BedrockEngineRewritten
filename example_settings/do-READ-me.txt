DO NOT PUT YOUR SKINS TO ASSETS, BEDROCK WILL IGNORE ASSETS FOLDER IF YOU DON'T MESS WITH SOURCE


more options will be ported to these jsons if needed.

------------------UI------------------

iconSupport means 300x150 icon support.
those icons need to be placed on mods/images/icons-old


NOTE SKINS

Available note skins are:
-NOTE_assets
-NOTE_circle
-NOTE_bar
-NOTE_diamond
-NOTE_step
-NOTE_simplyarrow

you can also add your own noteskins
just place them on "mods/images/noteskins"

if a skin doesn't have a pixel variant, pixel stages will crash
so make sure to create or copy any existing skin to mods/pixelUI/noteskins so your noteskin won't crash

JUDGEMENT SKINS

Available judgement skins are:

-classic
-bedrock

You can also add your own judgement skins,
just place them on "mods/images/judgements".

At the moment, botplay crashes no matter which noteskins or judgement skin you are using, this will be fixed soon.
